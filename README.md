# Job-Portal
This project is a comprehensive job portal built with the MERN stack. It includes user authentication, job filtering, and features like file uploads with Multer, Redux Toolkit for state management, and protected routes. Users can manage profiles, apply for jobs, and admins can oversee applications and listings effectively.
